# Vibe Coding Iterator - Core Development Rules

## First Action
Read README.md in each new chat session.

## Knowledge Updates
Use internet search for up-to-date information on all technologies and libraries before coding.

## Git
- Never commit to git but allow the human developer to do code review and commit
- Always write commit headers as feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|build|ci|chore|revert [optional-scope]: imperative summary per Conventional Commits 1.0.0; keep header â‰¤50 chars, body optional, add ! + BREAKING CHANGE: footer for API breaks, one logical change per commit
- When asked to suggest commit messages or when useful, use git commands to review changes and suggest appropriate commit messages following the above format

## Files and Dependencies
- Never delete files outside project directory
- May delete files within project except .env
- Ask permission before installing 3rd party software (pip packages are auto-approved)

## Code Standards
- Type hints on all functions
- Environment variables for configuration (VIBES_ prefix, uppercase)
- Simple function signatures - no parameter passing of config
- stdout logging only
- Terminal-based interaction only
- Use Rich for all terminal formatting, colors, progress bars, and UI effects following docs/ui-guidelines.md standards
- Never use tqdm, prompt-toolkit, or similar terminal frameworks - Rich is the only approved terminal enhancement library
- Never create UI that uses keyboard controls like arrow keys.
- Self-documenting code with minimal comments
- When developing new features, always try to find a way to test it and verify the result before starting implementation, by making a test script or similar, then implement it while iterating on the test

## Architecture Requirements
- Core API modules shared between evals and iteration system
- Single HTTP client in src/deepinfra_client.py
- Rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive error handling
- Project-specific conda environment (sanitized project name)

## DeepInfra Integration
- Single model provider only
- All API calls through src/deepinfra_client.py
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Response validation before processing

## Autonomous Loop Structure
1. Generate/modify code via DeepInfra models
2. Render and screenshot with Playwright
3. Analyze with vision models
4. Process feedback to instructions
5. Apply via Aider non-interactively
6. Continue or await intervention

## State Continuity
Always pull from git after a human has done manual intervention to get the most up-to-date version of the project files.
